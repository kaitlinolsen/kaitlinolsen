## Translocation of Pāua from Waikouati River Mouth to Butterfly Bay 

By: Kaitlin Olsen, Alexandara Faulkner, Lily Harvey, and Maddison Hafoka 

This project involved the movement of 120 Blackfoot pāua from Waikouati River Mouth to Butterfly Bay. A population desnity survey was taken prior to translocation for assesment of current population, recording lengths and count. Pāua being translocated the following day were also recorded with the same variables and put into associating release methods. Count of pāua a day after initial translocation was recorded to determine viability of translocation site. 

## ./data/input/
- 'population_density_survey.csv': formally 'populationdensitysurvey.xlsx' Quadrat number, meterage surveyed, pāua count in quadrat, and length of all pāua found. Short description of habitat also included. data has been summarised with corresponding ID's to create graph outputs

| Code         | Meaning                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| QN | Quadrat location on transect  (*meters*) |
| Average Length  | *millimeters*              |
| Sand Coverage   | *percent*          |

- 'population_density_of_translocated.csv': formally 'populationdensityoftranslocatedpaua.xlsx' length measurements *millimeters* of pāua selected for translocation, release type and associated release number

| Code         | Meaning                           |
