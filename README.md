## Translocation of Pāua from Waikouati River Mouth to Butterfly Bay AQFI301 2023 November Trip

By: Kaitlin Olsen, Alexandra Faulkner, Lily Harvey, and Maddison Hafoka 

This project involved the movement of 120 Blackfoot pāua (Haliotis iris) from Waikouati River Mouth to Butterfly Bay. A population density survey was taken prior to translocation for assessment of the current population, recording lengths and counts across a 30-meter transect line. Pāua being translocated the following day were also recorded with the same variables and put into associating release methods. There were two types of release method this included hard release (pāua translocated with in a dive catch bag and directly placed onto rock at translocated site) and soft release (the use of pōhā made from Southern Bull kelp, where pāua were placed at translocaton site with the pōhā) A count of pāua a day after initial translocation was recorded to determine the viability of the translocation site.  

## ./data/input/
- 'population_density_survey.csv': formally 'populationdensitysurvey.xlsx' Quadrat number, meterage surveyed, pāua count in quadrat, and length of all pāua found. A short description of the habitat is also included. data has been summarised with corresponding ID's to create graph outputs
